My name is Christopher Lopez and Im Mexican-American. I work born and raised in Queens, New York. I began going to school at The Borough of Manhattan Community College where I was originally majoring in Engineering, but I soon realized that I did not want to do that at all since I hate math and science. I then changed my major to design because I liked anything that had to do with art and design since I was little. I really enjoyed going to that school because the professors there were really helpful and helped me learn a lot of things that helped me be who I am today.

After graduating I decided to take a semester off because I did not want to attend City Tech. That is where I decided to apply to F.I.T and Queens College. My goal was to attend F.I.T, but after creating my portfolio and getting interviewed I was highly disappointed due to the fact that the staff was constantly losing my things, the design department never answered my emails and never emailed me important information regarding my interview. What was even more disappointing was that while getting interviewed the main person interviewing me was not paying attention as I was presenting my projects and she even got up at some point and walked away. Overall it was a bad experince and very disappointing because not only did they not know that I was a transfer student, but they also told me that I was not a priority student because I did not go to that school and I was transferring which they do not mention at all on their website.

Somethings that I really enjoy are cars and photography. I always liked cars since I was in kindergarden and it has always been my passion. I began taking photos my sophmore year of high school when I got my first phone. I then began to progress and got a camera as a gift where I was able to teach myself how to take the best photos and make them even better while editing them. Some website I like to visit are <a href="https://www.juxtapoz.com/">Juxtapoz Magazine</a> and <a href="https://www.Superstreetonline.com/">Superstreet Magazine</a>.
